# Swift_Express_App_Test
Sample app to learn how to use Swift and Express.js

To run the app, do the following:

1. Go to the noteapp_api folder in the Terminal and type 'npm install'. You should see a few NPM warnings about missing descriptions, repository fields, and a README file. Underneath that you'll see a list of modules being installed with names like express and body-parser. These are installed into noteapp_api/node_modules.

2. In the noteapp_api folder, type 'node app.js' and hit Enter. You won't see anything after that, but if you open a web browser and enter http://localhost:8080/notes, you should see {("name":"Sample Note"}) if things are working.
